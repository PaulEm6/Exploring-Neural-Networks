# Neural Networks: Fine Tuning vs Transfer Learning
 In this project we will expirement with neural networks. Our use case will be image classification, we will be comparing the results of a neural network that we fine tuned with a neural network that was already trained for image classification
 
**Objective:**  
The objective of this project is to compare the performance of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained from scratch with one trained using transfer learning. The comparison will be based on a dataset of plantation images sourced from Kaggle. The dataset consists of images of five types of plantations: jute, corn, rice, wheat, and sugarcane.

**Dependencies:**  
- Python packages utilized:
  - Keras: for building and configuring the CNN models
  - Scikitlearn: For analyzing the performance of the models
  - Matplotlib: For representing the performance of the models
  - Other necessary libraries for data handling and visualization

**Algorithm Performance:**  
The project will present the methodology, design choices, and reasons for designing the CNN models. It will also include an analysis of the results obtained from both the CNN trained from scratch and the CNN trained using transfer learning. 

**Usage:**  
Execute the `train.py` script to train the CNN models. 
```
python train.py
```

**Potential Applications:**  
The findings of this project could be valuable in understanding the effectiveness of transfer learning compared to training CNNs from scratch. This knowledge can be applied in various fields, such as agriculture, image classification, and machine learning research.
